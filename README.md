# Adaptive Cruise Control
Automotive Electronics
## Overview

This project involves the development of an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system using Simulink. ACC is an advanced driver assistance system that automatically adjusts the vehicle speed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead. This system enhances driving comfort and safety by reducing the need for manual speed adjustments.

## Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)

### Introduction

Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) is a sophisticated system that uses sensors and control algorithms to maintain a set speed and a safe following distance from the vehicle in front. It is an enhancement over traditional cruise control systems, offering additional functionality to handle varying traffic conditions.

### Key Features

- **Speed Maintenance**: Automatically maintains the set speed.
- **Distance Control**: Adjusts the vehicle speed to keep a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
- **Collision Avoidance**: Helps in preventing rear-end collisions by slowing down or stopping the vehicle if necessary.
